> [Zerto](https://www.zerto.com/zerto-platform/overview/) is a commercial product that provides disaster recovery, ransomware resilience and workload mobility software for virtualized infrastructures and cloud environments.

Support for Zerto always require an active maintenance contract and is divided into two phases.

End of Bug Fixes: commercially reasonable efforts for a solution will be taken,
but new bugs will not be resolved, unless they are critical.

End of Support Life: the version is no longer supported and an upgrade is required before
troubleshooting can be started.
