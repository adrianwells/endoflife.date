> [Zerto](https://www.zerto.com/zerto-platform/overview/) is a commercial disaster recovery

Support for Zerto always require an active maintenance contract and is divided into two phases.

As each new Zerto version is released, older versions approach their
End of Bug Fixes and End of Support Life:

End of Bug Fixes: commercially reasonable efforts for a solution will be taken,
but new bugs will not be resolved, unless they are critical.

End of Support Life: the version is no longer supported and an upgrade is required before
troubleshooting can be started.
