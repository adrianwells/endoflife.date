> [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/qsg_vsphere/about_vbr.html?ver=120) is a data protection and disaster recovery solution for virtual, physical and cloud environments.

## End of Fix

When a product version reaches this stage, no further Updates, Patches or Hotfixes will be created for it (exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis). A version that has reached End of Fix, but that has not reached End of Support is still fully supported. However, if Veeam determines that an issue is being experinced is fixed in a generally available version, an update to later release is required.

## End of support
  
When a product version reaches this stage, this version will no longer be supported by Veeam. To get support, one needs to have an active maintenance contract and perform an upgrade to at least the version that has not reached the End of Support stage yet.

## RTM (Release to Manufacturing) vs GA (General Availability)

RTM: This is the version of the software that is provided to manufacturers to bundle into future versions of their hardware products. It’s a more or less finalized version of the software but might still have some bugs that were not found during the testing phase.
GA: This is the fully tested and finalized version of the software that is available to all customers. It’s intended for all users and is considered ready for production environments.
